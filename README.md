# MetadataExtended

CityJSON Extension to store ISO19115-compliant metadata, extends the few metadata properties of the core.

Works with CityJSON v1.1+

The v1.1 core has now only those 6 properties allowed:

  - citymodelIdentifier
  - datasetTitle
  - datasetReferenceDate
  - geographicalExtent
  - geographicLocation
  - referenceSystem

and the Extensions adds several ISO19115-compliant properties, see the paper [A metadata ADE for CityGML](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40965-018-0057-4) for details.
